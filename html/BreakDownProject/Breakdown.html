        Breakdown of Project
    </div>
    <div class="styled-text">
        The Overall project is based on the idea of learning wavelengths in a visual, fun, and safe manner. We achieve this
        by using LEDs that change from a variety of colors depending on how close or far you are. You might ask, "what if no user
        is near?" and we've added an additional idle LED setting to view. Let's take a look below at the components and bring
        everything together for a breakdown.

            <p>Below is an image of the Power Supply and Micro-Controller used 
               power and program the LEDs. The LED's generate plently of heat, when providing the user with maximum light. However, 
               the power is controlled and maintained at safe voltage levels to prevent burning, blowout or blinding. The Microtroller is used in
               in combination with ardiuno, which is a programming language resposible for the patterns of the LEDs. The Microcontroller also recieves
               signals from the Li-Dar Sensor to alternate colors or remain idle.</p>

            <p>Below is an image of the prototype, which includes the LED's. The LED's themseleves are programmed to be in sync and required individual
            testing based off are Software and Hardware Engineer Tyler. The LED's were discussed for not only heat but spacing due to the area we were given 
            at the GLSC (Great Lake Science Center) and the visual we wanted to provide the user. Lastly, The LED design is also Horizontal for the provided space
            and wall given. </p>

            <p>Below is the Structure used to hold the acrylic glass, Logan created this structure using "Solidworks" which is widely used in Mechanical Engineering
             for creating foundations, instruments or any item/object that requires precise measurements. If you look closley you can see the detail of the drilling needed
             in the first bubble and the struture holder in the second bubble. </p>
