 <center>   <p><em><q>LiDAR sensors are commonly used in autonomous vehicles, robotics, and industrial automation for their precise distance measurement and object detection capabilities.
 LiDAR, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, is a sensor technology that uses laser light to measure distances and create detailed, three-dimensional maps of the surrounding environment.

<center>   <p><em><q>This allows the a person to be detected and this triggers the electronic sinal inside the microcontroller.Wavelegnths are great for describing behavior and characteristic of a person/object.
According to KhanAcademy.org "If the observer and source are moving toward each other, then the frequency increases and the wavelength decreases". Hence, the Microcontroller adjust
the patterns of the LEDs accordingly to the wavelenght of the user.
